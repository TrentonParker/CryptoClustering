# CryptoClustering

**This is my repository for the Module 11 Challenge, 'CryptoClustering'. In this challenge, I was able to scale data and use two different methods (K-Means and PCA) to cluster and analyze the data. Using these two methods allowed me to examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year. Overall it went well, the only trouble I had was keeping the index from the original DataFrame after fitting / transforming the data, which I was able to figure out by moving the index values to a column, and then setting that column as the index after fitting.**
